This is a numerical model for the surface semi-geostrophic turbulence by following Ragone, F., and G. Badin, 2016: A study of surface semi-geostrophic turbulence: Freely decaying dynamics. J. Fluid Mech., 792, 740â€“774, https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2016.116. The variables used in the model and the reference paper are non-dimensional; they are nondimensionalized by the characteristic scales defined in
