- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zy-gdou
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in CFD simulations with applications to oceanic and atmospheric dynamics using idealized numerical models scripted using MATLAB.
- ðŸŒ± One of such idealized models is the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) model. One advantage of this model is that it allows oceanographers to diagnose the 3D flow current from a single snapshot of the surface density perturbaiton (or sea surface temperature, SST). Modern satellite remote sensing could provide detailed surface information to a high-spatial resolution (upto ~1 km), thus openning an acesss to diagnose the upper ocean current up to the depth of the thermalcline and down to the horizontal scale of a few km. Thus the diagnosed flow field processes a higher spatial resolution than the geostrophic current directly observed by the satellite altimetry. Another interesting feature of the SQG flow is an abundance of small-scale structures: filaments and vortices are allowed to survive for quite a long time in the SQG current, which is contrary to the case of two-dimensional(Quasigeostrophic, QG) turbulence where the large-scale structures outlives the small ones. Thus the SQG model is promising in explaining the generation of part of the submesoscale structures in the ocean.

The SQG model has two high-order (in terms of the Rossby number) variants: the SQG+1 model and the SSG model.
