- 👋 Hi, I’m @zy-gdou
- 👀 I’m interested in CFD simulations with applications to oceanic and atmospheric dynamics using idealized numerical models scripted using MATLAB.
- 🌱 One of such idealized models is the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) model. One advantage of this model is that it allows oceanographers to diagnose the 3D flow current from a single snapshot of the surface density perturbaiton (or sea surface temperature, SST). Modern satellite remote sensing could provide detailed surface information to a high-spatial resolution (upto ~1 km), thus openning an acesss to diagnose the upper ocean current up to the depth of the thermalcline and down to the horizontal scale of a few km. Thus the diagnosed flow field processes a higher spatial resolution than the geostrophic current directly observed by the satellite altimetry. Another interesting feature of the SQG flow is an abundance of small-scale structures: filaments and vortices are allowed to survive for quite a long time in the SQG current, which is contrary to the case of two-dimensional(Quasigeostrophic, QG) turbulence where the large-scale structures outlives the small ones. Thus the SQG model is promising in explaining the generation of part of the submesoscale structures in the ocean.
