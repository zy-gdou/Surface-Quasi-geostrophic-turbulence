- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zy-gdou
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in CFD simulations with applications to oceanic and atmospheric dynamics using mainly MATLAB
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on the a few idealized numerical models. The surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) model is one of them. One advantage of this model is that it allows oceanographers to diagnose the 3D flow current from a single snapshot of the surface density perturbaiton (or sea surface temperature, SST). The surface information could be provided by the satellite remote sensing with a high-spatial resolution (upto 1 km), thus openning an acesss to diagnose the upper ocean current up to the depth of the thermalcline and down to the horizontal scale of a few km. Another interesting feature of the SQG flow is that it bears more small-scale structures like submesoscale filaments and vortices than the traditional quasi-gesotrophic model(2D turbulence), making it a candidative meachnism for the dissipation of the oceanic kinetic energy.
