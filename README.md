- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zy-gdou
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in CFD simulations with applications to oceanic and atmospheric dynamics using idealized numerical models scripted using MATLAB.
- ðŸŒ± One of such idealized models is the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) model. This model allows oceanographers to diagnose the 3D flow current from a single snapshot of the surface density perturbaiton (or sea surface temperature, SST). Modern satellite remote sensing can provide detailed surface information to a high spatial resolution of ~1 km, thus opening an acesss to diagnose the upper ocean current down to the horizontal scale of a few km. The resolution is beyond the 1/4 degree of the commonly-used geostrophic current provided by AVISO . Another interesting feature of the SQG flow is an abundance of small-scale structures. Filaments and vortices are allowed to survive for quite a long time in the SQG current. In contrast, in the two-dimensional (or Quasigeostrophic/QG) turbulence, the large-scale structures outlives the small ones. Thus, the SQG model is promising in explaining part of the generation of the submesoscale structures in the ocean.

"beta-SQG/" adds the $\beta$-effect in the classic SQG current. There, one can explore the Rossby wave dynamics, the Rhines scales and stuff related to the $\beta$-effect in the context of the SQG dynamics. It should be noted that the Lagrangian-conserved quantity in the SQG flow is the surface buoyancy perturbation $b_s(x,y,t)$, intead of the absolute vorticity in QG counterpart. Thus the $\beta$-effect represents a permannent gradient in the background buoyancy/density, which also triggers Rossby waves without surprise.

The SQG model is still constrained by the assumption of small Rossby number. At submesoscales, the Rossby number is not necessarily small and nonlinear advectoin plays a significant role. In order to better resolve the nonlinearity but still under a small Rossby number, two high-order (in terms of the Rossby number) variants of the SQG model are proposed: the SQG+1 model and the SSG model.

"SSG/" contains the codes used for a free-decaying SSG turbulence.
