- 👋 Hi, I’m @zy-gdou
- 👀 I’m interested in CFD & GFD simulations with applications to oceanic and atmospheric dynamics
- 🌱 I’m currently working on the Surface Quasi-geostrophic dynamics(and its high-order variants) and their potential connection and contribution to the interior quasi-gesotrophic dynamics of the ocean
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this subject
